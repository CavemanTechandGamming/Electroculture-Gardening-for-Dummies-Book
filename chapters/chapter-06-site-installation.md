## 🎯 Site Selection: Where to Place Your Antennae

Choosing the right location for your electroculture antennae is crucial for both effectiveness and safety. The placement can make the difference between a successful experiment and a disappointing result.

### **Key Factors for Site Selection**

#### **1. Garden Layout and Size**
- **Small gardens** (under 100 sq ft): 1-2 antennae
- **Medium gardens** (100-500 sq ft): 2-4 antennae
- **Large gardens** (over 500 sq ft): 4+ antennae
- **Container gardens**: 1 antenna per 4-6 containers

#### **2. Plant Types and Growth Patterns**
- **Root crops** (carrots, potatoes): Place antennae near planting rows
- **Leafy greens**: Position for even coverage across the bed
- **Fruiting plants**: Focus on areas with heavy fruit production
- **Tall plants**: Consider vertical antennae or elevated positioning

#### **3. Existing Garden Features**
- **Raised beds**: Perfect for loop antennae around the perimeter
- **Container gardens**: Spiral antennae work well in individual pots
- **In-ground plots**: Spiral or rod antennae for flexible placement
- **Greenhouses**: Consider indoor-specific designs
